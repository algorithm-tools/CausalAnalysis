# Automatically synchronize the master repository
> Automatically synchronize the code from the main repository (upstream) to your repository (origin) to keep your repository code synchronized with the main repository code.

**Steps**
- Fork the main repository to your GitHub account.
- Click on the repository you want to fork, and click on the Actions tab.
- You will be prompted for some information, click the `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them` button.
- Once this is done, the synchronization will be performed at 00:00:00 every day. If the workflow file is not changed, the synchronization will continue to be performed automatically according to the timer configuration.
